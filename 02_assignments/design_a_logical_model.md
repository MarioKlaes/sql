# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
There are many privacy implications:
1. the client's information is accessible to any employee
2. the purchase values are accessible to any employee

```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?

```
The AdventureWorks Schemma is much more detailed/sophisticated.

While all client information is in one table on this exercise, the AdventureWorks Schemma allows a client to have multiple phone numbers and addresses. It also differentiates between business and private entities.

The sales are also much more detailed at AdventureWorks Schemma. It allows purchases in different currencies, special offers, and multiple stores.

Comparing both models, I would improve my model with more details about my clients and sales. I would also allow the client to have more than one address. Another improvement would be to consider business clients in my model. 

Although it is interesting, I would not save credit card numbers on my model to protect clients' payment information.
