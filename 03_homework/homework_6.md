# Ethics in Project Management

As a Senior Manager at Bell Canada, my role encompasses initiating projects by crafting business cases to assess economic feasibility and project profitability. Additionally, I document the methodologies for measuring benefits post-project completion.

Two fundamental ethical principles underscore my approach:

1. I refrain from creating business cases for projects pertaining to health and safety. The human life is immeasurable and should never be subjected to financial evaluation.

2. I don't formulate business cases centred on compliance with laws or by-laws. Legal adherence is non-negotiable, and I refuse to quantify the potential advantages of flouting regulations.

Furthermore, I actively engage in forums to evaluate and prioritize activities and initiatives that, while not directly linked to ongoing projects, hold significant organizational value.

During my first planning and review workshop at Bell, I proposed the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize projects:

1. Projects concerning the safety and security of employees, contractors, or clients receive top priority.
2. No projects resulting directly in job loss (eliminating working positions) should be considered for a vote. This decision rests only within the realm of executive responsibility and cannot be delegated.
3. Projects or initiatives related to education or training are accorded high priority.

# Ethics in Systems and Data

Ethics change from culture to culture and sometimes from person to person within the same culture. They also change over time. They depend on the reality a person is experiencing (peace, war, famine, abundance, etc.). In the past, common sense was enough to establish a basic ethical set of rules, but not anymore. 

Reducing bias in data, systems, policies, and processes is a constant effort. Most people find it difficult to put themselves in somebody else's shoes and understand different points of view; that is why diversity has to be cultivated. In a bias reduction debate, the more diverse the people and points of view, the better the results one can achieve.
